OSINT for Red Team Exercises #4 - Deep/Dark Web Search PT.1

The concept of the deep and dark web is quite controversial, so I’ll leave it to each person to form their own opinion. However, if you want to learn more about it, I recommend this video by David Bombal featuring John Hammond:

Why would a Red Team use the deep web?
- Gathering information about attacks (exploits, malware, techniques, etc.)
- Investigating data breaches to use in campaigns and complement attack surface management.
- Hiding traffic for activities by using I2P and TOR networks to simulate an APT.

In Practice:

Researching is one of the primary objectives. Understanding how cybercriminals operate helps simulate attacks. However, it’s evident that a lot of information out there is irrelevant, so filtering and selecting valuable data is a crucial task.

Some resources that can assist you include tor2web, Ahmia, The Hidden Wiki, DuckDuckGo, or if you prefer, the OnionSearch script:

Another useful tool for research is Darkus:

Summary:
The more intelligence sources you have, the more effective you will be in structuring Red Team engagement exercises.

Manage your findings carefully and maintain OPSEC. Avoid using your personal Gmail account to register on such sites. And, of course, explore other networks besides TOR.
